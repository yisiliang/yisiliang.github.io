      This will be done this way to guarantee that GTIDs are added to
      gtid_executed in order, to avoid creating unnecessary temporary
      gaps and keep gtid_executed as a single interval at all times.

      If we allow each thread to call update_on_commit only when they
      are at finish_commit, the GTID order cannot be guaranteed and
      temporary gaps may appear in gtid_executed. When this happen,
      the server would have to add and remove intervals from the
      Gtid_set, and adding and removing intervals requires a mutex,
      which would reduce performance.
